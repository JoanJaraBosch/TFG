# TFG
This repository is for testing and uploading our final bachelor's project.

### After git clone
```
  cd TFG
  sudo ./start-monitoring.sh
```
Now you have to go to yiour master ip https://ip:443 and https://ip:3000 to accept your own certificates. <br/>
If you are using google chrome you only need to go to https://ip:443 and finally you can see the monitor web app.
